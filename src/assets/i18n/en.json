		"1": "F.A.Q.",

		"3": "What legal documents are required when selling or renting my property?",
		"4": "The sale or rental of real estate increasingly requires the production of several documents before any publication.",
		"5": "For example, the presence of an energy certificate is an obligation and its absence may result in a fine. ",
		"6": "The Braxel real estate is surrounded by experienced professionals for all the necessary fields (various certificates, surveyor, notaries, etc). We will help you with each legal step in the marketing of your property.",
		"7": "What is the subsequent intervention file?",
		"8": "At the latest for the day of the authentic act of sale, it is an obligation to submit a file of subsequent intervention to the buyer of your property.\nA sort of maintenance book for the property, this obligation was put in place in 2001 and must contain details of the work carried out, workers and materials used.\nWhether you are installing a new kitchen, changing the boiler or simply refreshing the paintings, always try to keep a description of the work and the invoices proving it.\nIn any case, do not worry, your Braxel agent will help you establish with you all the documents to be transmitted in the context of a property sale.",
		"9": "As a lessor, how do you register your principal residence lease?",
		"10": "The obligation to register the lease contract is not new. Failure to register within the time limit can have catastrophic consequences for the lessor. Renting a property involves signing a lease contract accompanied by a detailed and impartial inventory, all recorded.\nThis type of approach is fully supported by your Braxel real estate agency.\nNo, our service does not stop at the signing of the lease.",
		"11": "How can I have my property valued by a Braxel real estate agent?",
		"12": "Nothing's easier! Contact us by email at info@braxel.be or by phone on 02/319.51.51. We will be happy to meet you on site and share our analysis with you through a detailed report.\nThis service is completely free and without obligation.",
		"13": "Lessor owner, I wish to occupy my rental property When can I occupy it? What actions should I take?",
		"14": "As an owner, you always have the possibility of living in your rented property. In general, the lessor can finish the lease for various reasons, the most common of which are personal occupation and the cause of major work. The notice and any compensation vary depending on the type of lease contract that has been signed with the tenant. Our real estate agents will be happy to guide you through these steps in order to envisage a peaceful transition.",
		"15": "How can I buy a property by precisely assessing the future work to be undertaken?",
		"16": "As a purchaser who is not a professional, it is not always easy to accurately assess the value of the work to be planned for your potential property. No problem, we can put you in touch with the professional you need. As a result, you will be able to budget wisely for the whole operation and react as quickly as possible.",
		"17": "Given the low bank interest rates, I want to invest a part of my capital in real estate. What return can I expect in Brabant? In Brussels? What type of property should I aim for?",
		"18": "With bank interest rates being excessively low, many people choose to boost their equity by invest in real estate. The process is logical, sure and mathematical. However, this investment must be adapted to your needs and your medium and long-term projects. The challenge is to find the right balance between the direct return on rent, the latent added value of the property and the expected investment period. BRAXEL will advise you on the right investment and will give you the potential return in complete transparency.",
		"19": "I wish to resell my property, what about the taxation on the capital gain?",
		"20": "Do you own your property as a physical person or as a company? Is this a new house or apartment, existing for more than 5 years? Is it a land? What can I deduct from the taxable base if it is due?\nAnswering this question without knowing your situation would be quite approximate and therefore against our spirit. The service of a real estate agent is not just a sum of administrative and practical procedures. We wish to support you in a complete and precise manner in the overall reflection of your approach.\nGenerally speaking, properties owned in person are not taxed on the capital gain if the act of purchase and the act of resale are spaced more than 5 years apart. The rule is similar for undeveloped land, if the period is more than 8 years.",
		"21": "What work must be done before the sale is put up for sale?",
		"22": "Judicious questioning, whose action in response must be fitting!\nThe first point is to carry out imperative technical work to avoid any hidden defect. Doubt can cause the purchaser's loss of confidence and backfire.\nThe second point can be to do work or small refreshments which are useful to enhance your property, but here also caution; on the first hand, it is necessary to preserve your profitability and, on the other hand, it is up to the candidate to optimize the potential of your property in his own way.\nThe expertise of Braxel brokers in this competence is yours to avoid false steps.",
		"23": "Can I pay a part of my property purchase in cash?",
		"24": "The answer is no. The anti-money laundering law is very clear on this subject, the sale price of a property must be paid by a transfer or a certified bank check.\nIt is also required that the account number from which the money was debited, like the credit account, be mentioned in the agreement under private signature and in the final authentic sale. This is as much the case for the payment of the total price as for the payment but for a deposit. If this is not the case, the notary and the real estate agent must inform the financial information processing unit (CTIF).",
